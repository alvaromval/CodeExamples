EVALCOMIX: This is a project designed and developed for the University of Cadiz. I implemented it 3 years ago
Basically there are two parts:

	- EvalCOMIX3Client --> This folder contains the user interface, implemented using Adobe Flex sdk
	- EvalCOMIX3Backend --> This folder contains the backend, implemented using Grails (Ruby on Rails on the jvm)

	The comunication betwenn client and server has been implemented using REST services
	I also used a MySql for the database and an Apache Tomcat as a server
	
	The project is currently located in: http://evalcomix.uca.es/
